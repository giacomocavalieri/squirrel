# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

## 4.5.0 - 2025-10-24

- Squirrel will no longer perform code generation if there's any errors in the
  queries. Before it would still generate code for the queries with no errors.
  This would usually lead the codebase in a broken state until all the errors
  were fixed.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- When trying to use a `timestamptz`, squirrel will now show a useful hint
  nudging to use a `timestamp` instead.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## 4.4.2 - 2025-10-06

- Fix a bug where squirrel would generate invalid code for enums with a long
  name.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## 4.4.1 - 2025-08-25

- Squirrel now adds return type annotations to the generated code.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## 4.4.0 - 2025-08-25

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## 4.2.0 - 2025-07-31

- Before writing the generated queries, Squirrel will make sure to not overwrite
  any file that was not automatically generated.
  In case a file with the same name already exists, Squirrel will refuse to
  overwrite it and prompt the used to first rename the existing file.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Squirrel will now include a doc comment at the beginning of each generated
  module, explaining where the queries come from and what version of squirrel
  was used to generate the code.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## 4.1.0 - 2025-07-28

- Squirrel will now pick files under a project's `test` and `dev` directories.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed a bug where Squirrel wouldn't be able to generate code for `.sql` files

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed a bug where queries would not be generated in a reproducible order,
  causing `squirrel check` to fail unexpectedly.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## 4.0.1 - 2025-07-14

- Fixed a bug where using numeric types in a query would result in runtime
  decoding errors.

- Squirrel now supports the `time` type decoded and encoded as a
  [`calendar.TimeOfDay`](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_time/gleam/time/calendar.html#TimeOfDay).
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Squirrel now uses the
  [`calendar.Date`](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_time/gleam/time/calendar.html#Date)
  type to encode and decode `date`s.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Squirrel now uses the
  [`timestamp.Timestamp`](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_time/gleam/time/timestamp.html#Timestamp)
  type to encode and decode `timestamp`s.

  ```

  You can also change the timeout value when using a connection string, by
  setting the `connect_timeout` query parameter:

## v2.1.0 - 2024-12-22

- The version requirement for `pog` has been changed to only permit v3.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- The generated code no longer relies on the `decode` package and now uses the

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## v2.0.1 - 2024-11-18

- Fixed a bug where certain queries would generate code with the wrong optional
  types.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## v2.0.0 - 2024-11-11

- The generated code now uses the [`pog`](https://hexdocs.pm/pog/index.html)
  package instead of `gleam_pgo`.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## v1.8.1 - 2024-11-08

- Squirrel now errors if a query returns multiple columns with the same name
  instead of generating invalid Gleam code. For example:

  ```sql
  select
    1 as duplicate,
    2 as duplicate,
    3 as not_duplicate
  ```

  Results in the following error:

  ```txt
  Error: Duplicate names

      ╭─ query.sql
      │
    1 │ select
    2 │   1 as duplicate,
    3 │   2 as duplicate,
    4 │   3 as not_duplicate
      ┆

  This query returns multiple values sharing the same name: `duplicate`.
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Switched to `decode`'s new `zero` API for generated decoders.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Added support for user-defined enums. An enum like this one:

  ```sql
  create type squirrel_colour as enum (
    'light_brown',
    'grey',
    'red'
  )
  ```

  Is automatically turned into the equivalent Gleam type:

  ```gleam
  pub type SquirrelColour {
    LightBrown
    Grey
    Red
  }
  ```

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## v1.7.1 - 2024-09-22

- Fixed a bug where a query failing to parse would cause code generation for
  other queries to fail unexpectedly.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed a bug where a query starting with a semicolon would result in a crash
  instead of a proper syntax error.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed a bug where the generated code would have needless empty lines.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## v1.7.0 - 2024-09-09

  confusing error message.

  `#(#(Int, Int, Int), #(Int Int Int))` with
  `#(#(year, month, day), #(hour, minute, second))`.
  ([Tommy Heffernan](https://github.com/tdheff))

- Fixed a bug where the SQL query displayed in an error would be dimmed out.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## v1.6.0 - 2024-09-03

- Added support for the `date` type, represented as a triple `#(Int, Int, Int)`
  with `#(year, month, day)`.
  ([Giovanni Paone](https://github.com/PavoJ))

## v1.5.0 - 2024-08-19

- Added support for the `bytea` type, represented as a `BitArray`.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## v1.4.0 - 2024-08-16

- Added support for the `uuid` type, represented as a `Uuid` (from the `youid`
  package).
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed a bug where `gleam run -m squirrel` would return a `0` exit code even in
  case of errors.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## v1.3.2 - 2024-08-15

- Fixed a bug where the generated code would be missing a `gleam/list` import
  when dealing with Postgres arrays.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## v1.3.1 - 2024-08-15

- Fixed a bug where Squirrel would panic if not able to establish a TCP
  connection to the postgres server. Now it gracefully handles the error by
  showing an appropriate error message.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## v1.3.0 - 2024-08-13

- One can now use the `DATABASE_URL` env variable to specify a connection string
  that Squirrel will use to connect to the Postgres database.
  All the regular Postgres variables are still supported, but Squirrel will pick
  `DATABASE_URL` over those if it is set.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Added support for the `jsonb` type, encoded as a `Json` (from the `gleam_json`
  package) and decoded as a Gleam `String`.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Added support for the `json` type, encoded as `Json` (from the `gleam_json`
  package) and decoded as a Gleam `String`.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## v1.2.0 - 2024-08-12

- Squirrel now supports the `SCRAM-SHA-256` authentication.

- Squirrel now uses the name of your Gleam project as the default database name
  to connect to.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Fixed a bug where Squirrel couldn't generate code for queries that return no
  rows like `insert into`.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Avoid panicking when the authenticated user doesn't have the permission to
  access a given table.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

## v1.1.0 - 2024-08-11

- Squirrel now supports plaintext password authentication.
  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

  environment variable is not set.

  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))

- Improved the error message in case Squirrel cannot connect to the Postgres
  server with the given database and username.
  Instead of a not-really-helpful `Cannot receive message: Closed` the error now
  properly explains what went wrong and hot to solve the issue:

  ```
  Error: Cannot connect

  I couldn't connect to database `database` with user `postgres`.

  Hint: You can change the default user and database by setting the `PGUSER` and
  `PGDATABASE` environment variables.
  ```
