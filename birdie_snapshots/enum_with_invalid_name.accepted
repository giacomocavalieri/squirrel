One of the values in this query is the `1 invalid enum` enum, but I cannot turn
it into a Gleam type definition because its name cannot be turned into a valid
type name.

Hint: A valid enum name must start with a letter and can only contain letters,
underscores and numbers. I will take care automatically of converting any
snake_case name to PascalCase so that it can be used as the name of a Gleam
type!
