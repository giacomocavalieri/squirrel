One of the values in this query is the `invalid_fields` record, but I cannot
turn it into a Gleam type definition because some of its field names (`1 invalid
field`) cannot be turned into valid labels.

Hint: A valid field label must start with a letter and can only contain letters,
underscores and numbers. I will take care of automatically converting any name
into snake_case so that it can be used as a label in a Gleam type!
