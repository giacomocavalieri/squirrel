One of the values in this query is the `1 invalid type` custom type, but I
cannot turn it into a Gleam type definition because its name cannot be turned
into a valid type name.

Hint: A valid custom type name must start with a letter and can only contain
letters, underscores and numbers. I will take care automatically of converting
any snake_case name to PascalCase so that it can be used as the name of a Gleam
type!
