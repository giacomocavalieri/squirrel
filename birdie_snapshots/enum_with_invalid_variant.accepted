One of the values in this query is the `invalid_variant` enum, but I cannot turn
it into a Gleam type definition because some of its possible values (`1 invalid
value`) cannot be turned into valid type variants.

Hint: A valid enum variant must start with a letter and can only contain
letters, underscores and numbers. I will take care of automatically converting
any snake_case variant to PascalCase so that it can be used as a variant of a
Gleam type!
